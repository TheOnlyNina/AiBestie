# AiBestie

AiBestie is a **fun, experimental project** I created to practice Python and GUI development. It's a simple "AI bestie" chat interface where you can type messages and get responses from a custom AI personality.

---

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Workshop / personal artwork project to experiment with Python GUIs and playful AI interactions.
- **Inspiration:** The layout was inspired by my own Figma design.  
- **Current Status:** Work in progress.

---

## Features

- Fully hardcoded in **Python** using **PySide6** in VS Code.  
- Simple chat interface with scrollable messages.  
- Custom AI personality responding to your inputs.  
- Pixel-style fonts for a playful look (must be installed separately).  

---

## Notes

- The images/icons used in the project **are not owned by me**; they were found on Pinterest.  
- The font used for the chat interface must be **downloaded and installed** from the web to work correctly.
- I used my own OpenWeatherMap Token.

---

## Future Plans

- Improve the Enter key functionality for sending messages.  
- Fix the informations, it is written fully in Python and not HTML or TEX.
- Make it into a .exe application for easier download.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheOnlyNina/AiBestie.git

2. **Install dependencies (PySide6, OpenAI)**
